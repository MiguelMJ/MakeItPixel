# Contributing to MakeItPixel

Thanks for thinking about contributing to MakeItPixel! Here are the steps to do it.

1. Read this document (you are on the right path in this moment).
2. Check if there's any open issue with your idea, and whether it is already assigned to someone or not.
3. If it is not, then you can open a new issue or comment in the existent one and I will assign it to you.
4. Fork the repo and make your changes in the dev branch.
5. Make a pull request.

## Suggested pending improvements

This is a list of topics that could make it to a future version of MakeItPixel.

### Features
- **Palette extraction**. Adding options for palette extraction given an image is something I want to add in a future, so anything you can contribute in this line would be great.
- **Bluring parameters**. Enable parameters to blur the image before the re-scaling, similar to how normalization works.
- **Border detection**. Enable parameters for border detection, so the resulting image has the characteristic pixel art outlines.

### Other
- **Build system**. Add an easy way to install the dependencies and build the program.
- **Porting**. Include in the latest release a version of MakeItPixel for Windows.
- **Code cleanup**. Clean up and modularize some functions in `src/main.cpp`.

And of course any other feature, documentation, or improvement you can think of!
